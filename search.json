In the United States, these processes will follow your organization’s local interpretation for maintaining compliance to PII and PHI protection. In OMOP CDM implementations containing European Union citizen data, local governance processes will include measures to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1]. As a community, the OHDSI data network covers more than 500 databases from 49 countries. There is extensive community knowledge on the interpretation of rule sets and exemplar IRB and local governance workflows that can be made available to institutions navigating these processes for the first time. If your organization does not have an established data governance process, please reach out on the OHDSI Forums under “Implementers” and the community can respond with shared guidance from their own deployments. As a community, we aim to conduct research that keeps patient-level data local and share only aggregate results.\nPrivacy preserving processes are not one-size fits all.

Our group mainly supports health systems, hospitals, and others who have electronic health record (EHR) data on their OHDSI journey to produce reliable, reproducible evidence.\nThe Health Systems group meets every other Monday at 10am Eastern Time.
