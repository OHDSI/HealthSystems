	abstract = {Objective: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is a useful tool in both the clinic and research settings, aiding in the diagnosis and treatments of neurological disease and expanding our knowledge of the brain. However, there are many challenges inherent in managing and analyzing MRI data, due in large part to the heterogeneity of data acquisition. Materials and Methods: To address this, we have developed MRIO, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Acquisition and Analysis Ontology.
Results: MRIO provides well-reasoned classes and logical axioms for the acquisition of several MRI acquisition types and well-known, peer-reviewed analysis software, facilitating the use of MRI data. These classes provide a common language for the neuroimaging research process and help standardize the organization and analysis of MRI data for reproducible datasets. We also provide queries for automated assignment of analyses for given MRI types. Discussion: MRIO aids researchers in managing neuroimaging studies by helping organize and annotate MRI data and integrating with existing standards such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and the Brain Imaging Data Structure, enhancing reproducibility and interoperability. MRIO was constructed according to Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry principals and has contributed several terms to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations to help bridge neuroimaging data to other domains.
Conclusion: MRIO addresses the need for a "common language" for MRI that can help manage the neuroimaging research, by enabling researchers to identify appropriate analyses for sets of scans and facilitating data organization and reporting.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques require access to large inter-institutional cohorts of data to enable the development of robust models, e.g., targeting the identification of disease biomarkers and quantifying disease progression and treatment efficacy. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) has been designed to accommodate a harmonized representation of observational healthcare data. This study proposes the Medical Imaging CDM (MI-CDM) extension, adding two new tables and two vocabularies to the OMOP CDM to address the structural and semantic requirements to support imaging research. The tables provide the capabilities of linking DICOM data sources as well as tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from those images. The implementation of the extension enables phenotype definitions using imaging features and expanding standardized computable imaging biomarkers. This proposal offers a comprehensive and unified approach for conducting imaging research and outcome studies utilizing imaging features.},

	abstract = {Correctly counting entities is a requirement for analytics tools to function appropriately. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership’s (OMOP) Common Data Model specifications were examined to assess the extent to which counting in OMOP CDM compatible data repositories would work as expected. To that end, constructs (tables, fields and attributes) defined in the OMOP CDM as well as cardinality constraints and other business rules found in its documentation and related literature were compared to the types of entities and axioms proposed in realism-based ontologies. It was found that not only the model itself, but also a proposed standard algorithm for computing condition eras may lead to erroneous counting of several sorts of entities.},
